Motion Controlled Wearable LED Dance Harness
-------------------

This code will be used to control the 12V LED strips attached to a dancer's custom harness. For more information about building the harness, check out the [prototype wearable LED dance harness](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/prototype-wearable-led-dance-harness). Each harness is controlled using an n-channel MOSFET an accelerometer, and an Arduino Pro Mini for a performance with Streetside Studio's bboys/bgirls.

Repository Contents
-------------------
* **/Arduino** - Example code 
  * _MinionAccelerometerV2.0_ - Test code for 1 dancer.
  * _MinionAccelerometerV2.1_ - Code calibrated for all 8 dancers.

Documentation
--------------
* **[Project Tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/prototype-wearable-led-dance-harness)** - Hookup guide to make Mark II of the prototoype weable LED dance harness. The only difference is that Mark III uses an N-channel MOSFET, accelerometer, and an Arduino Pro Mini to control the colors.
