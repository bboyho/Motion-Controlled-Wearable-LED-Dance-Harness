/*Description: This code will be used to control the 12V LED strips
attached to a dancer's custom strap using an n-channel MOSFET for a
performance with Streetside Studio's bboys/bgirls.

Values calibrated using Earth's gravity when accelerometer at rest.
Depending on what accelerometer is used, change the global variable
calibration_M and calibrationADXL335() for that specific accelerometer.

-------Accelerometer Mode = 1 -------
Features
1.) xAxis
Standing = LED on
Upside down = LED Blinking

2.) yAxis
On the left or right side= LED off

3.) zAxis
On stomach or back = LED fading */
